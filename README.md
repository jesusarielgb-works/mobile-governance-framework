> Documentation manual and governance scaffold for **mobile applications** — stack-agnostic
> (Flutter, React Native, native iOS, native Android). A lighter companion to the
> microservices framework: the same manual-with-templates approach, fewer sections.

**Author:** [Jesus Ariel Gonzalez Bonilla](https://github.com/jesusarielgb-works)

This repository is a **documentation scaffold** for any mobile project. It contains no
project-specific information. Its purpose is to teach how to govern and document a mobile
app professionally — showing what goes in each section, why it matters, and how the
sections relate.

---

## How to use this framework

1. **Fork** (or copy the structure) into your project repository.
2. **Read** [`00-sdd-guide.md`](./00-sdd-guide.md) for the fill-in order and methodology.
3. **Read each section `README.md`** before filling in its documents — they explain what is expected.
4. **Copy the `_template-*` files** when you need to document a concrete feature, screen,
   decision, endpoint, entity, test case, or release. Fill in, rename, keep the original template.
5. **Adapt every neutral rule** to your concrete stack (Flutter / React Native / native).
6. Once a document is complete, remove the instruction blocks.

## Build flow — section dependencies

> `00-governance` wraps the entire project and applies to every section.
